* You can split your screen into multiple windows:
- Ctrl-x 2 splits vertically.
- Ctrl-x 3 splits horizontally.
- Ctrl-x 1 maximizes the current window.
- Shift + Arrows to move between windows

















* In my customized version of Emacs, most keystrokes you use throughout Mac OS X work the same way.

* Command+o or C-x C-f opens a file (created if doesn't exist)
* Command+s or C-x C-s saves a file
* Command+Shift+s or C-x C-w saves a file with a different name
* C-s finds text
* Command+Shift+f finds text in any buffer














* Each window can contain a different buffer.

* Ctrl-x k closes a buffer.
* Ctrl-x b shows a list of open buffers. Example of a transient buffer.
* Move among buffers with Command+[ and Command+]










* You can probably find the correct command by using M+x.
* If there is a keystroke bound to a command, C-h f will show it.
* If you don't know what a keystroke does, use C-h k.










* You can run a shell command in the current folder using M-!.
* You can open an entire terminal with M-x multi-term.





















* You can customize anything using M-x customize
* You can install new packages using M-x list-packages
