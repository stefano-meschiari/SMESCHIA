* M-x gives access to the minibuffer, where you can enter a command "long form".































* M-g can be used to get out of the minibuffer, or quit an action.





















* M-x help-with-tutorial opens a handy tutorial for Emacs. You should learn basic cursor movements and selections.






















* You can split your screen into multiple windows:
- Ctrl-x 2 splits vertically.
- Ctrl-x 3 splits horizontally.
- Ctrl-x 1 maximizes the current window.
- Shift + Arrows to move between windows






















* Each window can contain a different buffer.

* Ctrl-x k closes a buffer.
* Ctrl-x b shows a list of open buffers.










* You can probably find the correct command by using M+x.
* If there is a keystroke bound to a command, Ctrl-h f will show it.











* In my customized version of Emacs, most keystrokes you use throughout Mac OS X work the same way.
